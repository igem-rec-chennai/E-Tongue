## Motivation

Excess sodium intake is a global health concern, and there is a growing demand for foods that are both healthier and flavorful. By integrating SaltEnPep with an e-tongue, we achieve:

- **Quantitative validation of saltiness enhancement**  
- **Optimization of peptide sequences** for maximal flavor at minimal cost  
- **Support for low-sodium food development**  
- **Scalable, modular, high-throughput workflow** for rapid testing

This approach aligns with the vision of **precision flavor engineering** and demonstrates the convergence of synthetic biology and sensor technologies.

## Concept: Electronic Tongue

The **e-tongue** is an array of chemical sensors that mimic human taste perception. It includes:

- **Potentiometric sensors**: Detect Na‚Å∫ and other ions  
- **Amperometric sensors**: Sense saltiness-enhancing peptides using nanozyme-based electrodes  
- **Conductometric sensors**: Measure overall ionic strength  

Sensor outputs are processed via signal conditioning circuits connected to an **ESP32 microcontroller**, which streams data to AI models for **real-time taste classification**.
